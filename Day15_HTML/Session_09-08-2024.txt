HTML and Networking:
--------------------

Java, python, .net, php ----> backend server side programming
SQL, noSQL, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB ----> Database: To store data permanently
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Angular, React, Vue, jQuery ----> Frontend: To design the webpage

====================================================================================================

Web Application:
----------------
We need internet

Internet:
---------
Interconnected devices/ Network

It connects millions of computers, webpages, websites and servers.
Using internet, we can send emails

Different types of Network:
----------------------------
1. LAN (Local Area Network)
2. WAN (Wide Area Network)
3. MAN
4. PAN
5. VPN
6. Intranet
7. Extranet
8. Internet
====================================================================================================
What is IP Address?
-------------------
IP Address is a unique address of a computer in a network. It uniquely identifies a device in a network.

Difference between ip4 and ip6:
------------------------------
IPv4:
-----
1. 32 bit address
2. 4.3 billion addresses
3. 4 octets

IPv6:
-----
1. 128 bit address
2. 340 undecillion addresses
3. 8 octets

OSI Model:
----------
1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer
Let’s look at it with an Example:

Luffy sends an e-mail to his friend Zoro.

Step 1: Luffy interacts with e-mail application like Gmail, outlook, etc. Writes his email to send. (This happens in Layer 7: Application layer)

Step 2: Mail application prepares for data transmission like encrypting data and formatting it for transmission. (This happens in Layer 6: Presentation Layer)

Step 3: There is a connection established between the sender and receiver on the internet. (This happens in Layer 5: Session Layer)

Step 4: Email data is broken into smaller segments. It adds sequence number and error-checking information to maintain the reliability of the information. (This happens in Layer 4: Transport Layer)

Step 5: Addressing of packets is done in order to find the best route for transfer. (This happens in Layer 3: Network Layer)

Step 6: Data packets are encapsulated into frames, then MAC address is added for local devices and then it checks for error using error detection. (This happens in Layer 2: Data Link Layer)

Step 7: Lastly Frames are transmitted in the form of electrical/ optical signals over a physical network medium like ethernet cable or WiFi.

After the email reaches the receiver i.e. Zoro, the process will reverse and decrypt the e-mail content. At last, the email will be shown on Zoro’s email client.

Network Topology:
-----------------
Topology defines how the devices are connected in a network. There are different types of network topologies:

=========================================================================================================
Firewall:
---------
Firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network.

=========================================================================================================

Network Terminologies:
----------------------
- Node: A device connected to a network
- network: A collection of nodes connected together
- router: A device that forwards data packets between computer networks
- switch: A device that connects devices together on a computer network
- hub: A device that connects multiple Ethernet devices together
- gateway: A device that connects two networks together
- firewall: A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic
- bandwidth: The maximum rate of data transfer across a network
- latency: The time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination
- packet: A unit of data transmitted over a network
- protocol: A set of rules that govern data communication
- subnet: A logical subdivision of an IP network
- subnet mask: A number that separates the network and host parts of an IP address
- DNS: Domain Name System, a system that translates domain names to IP addresses
- DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, a protocol that assigns IP addresses to devices on a network
- VPN: Virtual Private Network, a secure network connection that allows users to access the internet privately
- NAT: Network Address Translation, a method of remapping one IP address space into another
- MAC address: Media Access Control address, a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces
- IP address: Internet Protocol address, a unique identifier assigned to devices on a network

- SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, a protocol used for sending email
- POP3: Post Office Protocol version 3, a protocol used for retrieving email
- IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol, a protocol used for retrieving email
- SSL: Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol that provides secure communication over a computer network
- TLS: Transport Layer Security, a protocol that provides secure communication over a computer network
- SSH: Secure Shell, a protocol that provides secure access to a computer over an unsecured network
- RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol, a protocol that allows remote access to a computer
- VoIP: Voice over Internet Protocol, a technology that allows voice communication over the internet

HTML 5:
-------
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to create web pages. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages.

Why we need HTML?
-----------------
To create a webpage, we need HTML. HTML is the basic building block of a webpage. 
It is used to create the structure of a webpage.

HTML Boilerplate Code:
----------------------
<!DOCTYPE html> : This is the declaration of the document type and version of HTML. This tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document.
<html> : This is the root element of an HTML page.
<head> : This element contains meta-information about the document, such as the title of the document, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
         seo: search engine optimization
         add external css and java script.
<title> : This element specifies the title of the document.
</head> : This element marks the end of the head section.
<body> : This element contains the content of the document, such as text, images, links, and other elements.
         It will be displayed on the browser.
</body> : This element marks the end of the body section.
</html> : This element marks the end of the HTML document.
========================================================================================================
HTML Tags:
----------
1. Paired
2. Unpaired

Paired Tags:                                                 Unpaired Tags:
------------                                                 -------------
1. These tags have an opening tag and a closing tag.          1. These tags do not have a closing tag.
2. The content goes between the opening and closing tags.     2. They are self-closing tags.
3. Example: <p>Content goes here</p>                          3. Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="image">

element:
--------
<h1></h1> ---> Tags
<h1>This is heading</h1>    (Tag and it has some content. This is called element)

attribute:
----------  
It provides additional behaviour to the tag.

========================================================================================================
HTML Elements Types:
---------------------
1. Block Level Elements: Has a line break before and after the element.
2. Inline Elements: Does not have a line break before and after the element. It takes only the required width.

HTML Hierarchy:
---------------
1. HTML
2. Head
3. Title

(ctrl + shift + L) ---> To include multiple cursors for a particular word.
(h1+h2+h3+h4+h5+h6) ---> Heading Tags
h1+p+h2+p

========================================================================================================
Table:
------
1. rowspan: It specifies the number of rows a cell should span.
